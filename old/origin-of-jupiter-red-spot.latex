Idea about origin of Jupiter Great Red Spot.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

This idea is based on photos of North and South poles of Jupiter made by NASAâ€™s Juno spacecraft.

\section{Origin of Jupiter Giant Red Spot}
\label{sec:origin}

\subsection{Observations}

From photo of Jupiter's North Pole, we can see that it contains 9 cyclones and anticyclones, with one large cyclone in the middle, and 8 cyclones and anticyclones around it. At photo of Jupiter's South pole, we see only 6 cyclones and anticyclones, with central anticyclone much weaker than at North pole.

\subsection{Idea}

Idea, proposed by author of this paper first at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16558143, is that central anticyclone from South pole was merged with two side cyclones, skewed, and then escaped South pole, so it known as Giant Red Spot now.
